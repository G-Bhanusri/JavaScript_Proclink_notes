# Type Script:

- microsoft invented TS
- TS is super script of JS- coz all features in js are there in TS
- Type script can understand js

- but js can't understand the Type script
  TS=Types+JS
- angular 1st adapted by Angular

# Reason why developers fall in love with TS:

1. Autocomplete
2. Inline errors--> development type error- means while typing only it gives error

```JS
let num1: Array<number>=[1,2,3]
let num2: number[]=[4,5,6] // forcing to take only numbers

num1.push("ABC")
// if the array is in one file and in another file some one is going to push, so TS will give error when we type it self , but JS will not give error while wrting and we can't even force array to take only numbers
```

3. Less Test Case-- it will solve the errors while building only
